formatX Examples

Usage
To use these examples, open DropScript.html and drag the examples into the drop box.
If your script depends on other scripts, add these scripts first.
You may also use the require function to add libraries (similar to what Node.js uses).

Known Bugs
Using the require function will first issue an error report in the browser console. This is due to asynchronous loading of the libraries. Upon this error, DropScript then tries to rerun the script again.
